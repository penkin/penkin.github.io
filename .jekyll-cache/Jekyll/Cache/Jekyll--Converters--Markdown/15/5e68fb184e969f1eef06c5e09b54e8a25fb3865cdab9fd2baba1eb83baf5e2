  <p>I got an Apple Watch to monitor my health; notifications got in the way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôve had an <a href="https://www.apple.com/watch/">Apple Watch</a> for a little while now. I got it mostly to help me monitor my health and send some of that information to my medical aid as part of their rewards program. The more I move, the more points I get, the more benefits I enjoy.</p>

<p>Seemed like a great idea, I love gadgets and a smartwatch that lets me auto-login to my MacBook, tell me how well I‚Äôm sleeping, how my heart is doing, how many steps I take; you get the point; seems like a great idea. Let‚Äôs not forget all those juicy points from my medical aid.</p>

<p>It had the reverse effect, I started getting frustrated with all the buzzing on my wrist. Did something happen on <a href="https://twitter.com/penkin">Twitter</a>? Buzz! Did someone send me an email? Buzz! Some text message spam? Buzz! Incessant interruptions that I could not ignore. I‚Äôd be in meetings and the cry for attention would buzz on my arm and I‚Äôd naturally look, others in the meeting would ask if I needed to be somewhere as though I was checking the time. How much longer is this boring meeting going to go on for sort of thing!</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>

<p>So I did not just stop using my watch, instead, I decided to just cut out the noise. On the Watch app on the iPhone, you can simply <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204791">turn notifications off</a>, either completely or select the apps you want to allow to grab your attention.</p>

<p>Initially, it felt extremely strange, instead of looking at my watch for why I was being buzzed, I was not looking at it for why it was not buzzing anymore. Is my watch dead? No, just less needy for attention. It‚Äôs been a week now and it‚Äôs amazing, I can sit through a meeting without distraction, continue to code without being torn away.</p>

<p>So as much as I wanted to use the device to help improve my health, the notifications got in the way. I found I ignored the ‚Äúimportant‚Äù ones in all the noise of the rest.</p>

<p><strong>I highly recommend carefully choosing what you allow to take your time and attention.</strong></p>
