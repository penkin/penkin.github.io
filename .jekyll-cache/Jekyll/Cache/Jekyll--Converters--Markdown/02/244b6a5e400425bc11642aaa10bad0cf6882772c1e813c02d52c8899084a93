I"È<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">R</span>ecently I ran into an issue where none of my breakpoints for my solution would get activated when I ran a pretty large [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/) solution. I tried cleaning the project and rebuilding which did not work. I was even desperate enough to reboot my machine, that‚Äôs when I know I‚Äôm at the end of my tether.</p>

<h2 id="bash-solution">Bash Solution</h2>

<p>Since the project I‚Äôm working on is pretty big, going through all the directories manually is super tedious. I work on OSX so I needed something that works in bash and here is what I came up with.</p>

<p>I created a file in the solution‚Äôs root directory called DeleteBinObjFolders.sh. I wrote the following in the file;</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"Deleting all bin and obj folders..."</span>
find <span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nt">-iname</span> <span class="s2">"bin"</span> <span class="nt">-o</span> <span class="nt">-iname</span> <span class="s2">"obj"</span> | xargs <span class="nb">rm</span> <span class="nt">-rf</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"Your bin and obj folders deleted!"</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>All that is left is to make the file executable with chmod +x DeleteBinObjFolders.sh. Now we are all good to run the file by entering ./DeleteBinObjFolders.sh in your terminal.</p>

<p><strong>BAM!</strong> All your bin and obj files are a thing of the past.</p>

<h2 id="bat-solution">BAT Solution</h2>

<p>I found the following solution on <a href="https://medium.com/volosoft/deleting-all-bin-obj-folders-in-a-solution-93e401372e69">Alper Ebi√ßoƒülu‚Äôs post</a> about the same issue. Basically do exactly the same as above but instead of using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.sh</code> extension, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bat</code>.</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bat" data-lang="bat">@echo <span class="na">off</span>
@echo <span class="kd">Deleting</span> <span class="kd">all</span> <span class="kd">BIN</span> <span class="kd">and</span> <span class="kd">OBJ</span> <span class="kd">folders</span>‚Ä¶for <span class="na">/d /r </span>. <span class="vm">%%d</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="kd">bin</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="kd">obj</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="k">do</span> @if <span class="ow">exist</span> ‚Äú<span class="vm">%%d</span>‚Äù <span class="nb">rd</span> <span class="na">/s/q </span>‚Äú<span class="vm">%%d</span>‚Äù@echo <span class="kd">BIN</span> <span class="kd">and</span> <span class="kd">OBJ</span> <span class="kd">folders</span> <span class="kd">successfully</span> <span class="kd">deleted</span> :<span class="o">)</span> <span class="kd">Close</span> <span class="kd">the</span> <span class="kd">window</span>.pause <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kr">nul</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Double click the bat file and <strong>BAM! Victory!</strong></p>
