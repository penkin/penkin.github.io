I"9<p>Recently I ran into an issue where none of my breakpoints for my solution would get activated when I ran a pretty large <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/">.NET Core</a> solution. I tried cleaning the project and rebuilding which did not work. I was even desperate enough to reboot my machine, that’s when I know I’m at the end of my tether.</p>

<h2 id="bash-solution">Bash Solution</h2>

<p>Since the project I’m working on is pretty big, going through all the directories manually is super tedious. I work on OSX so I needed something that works in bash and here is what I came up with.</p>

<p>I created a file in the solution’s root directory called DeleteBinObjFolders.sh. I wrote the following in the file;</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>echo "Deleting all bin and obj folders..."
find . -iname "bin" -o -iname "obj" | xargs rm -rf
echo "Your bin and obj folders deleted!"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All that is left is to make the file executable with chmod +x DeleteBinObjFolders.sh. Now we are all good to run the file by entering ./DeleteBinObjFolders.sh in your terminal.</p>

<p><strong>BAM!</strong> All your bin and obj files are a thing of the past.</p>

<h2 id="bat-solution">BAT Solution</h2>

<p>I found the following solution on <a href="https://medium.com/volosoft/deleting-all-bin-obj-folders-in-a-solution-93e401372e69">Alper Ebiçoğlu’s post</a> about the same issue. Basically do exactly the same as above but instead of using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.sh</code> extension, use ```.bat``.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@echo off
@echo Deleting all BIN and OBJ folders…for /d /r . %%d in (bin,obj) do @if exist “%%d” rd /s/q “%%d”@echo BIN and OBJ folders successfully deleted :) Close the window.pause &gt; nul
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Double click the bat file and <strong>BAM! Victory!</strong></p>
