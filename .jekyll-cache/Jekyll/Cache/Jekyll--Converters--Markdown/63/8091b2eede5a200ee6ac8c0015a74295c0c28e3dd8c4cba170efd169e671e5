I"ö<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ow has 2021 started at an incredible pace for me. Getting back into the projects I'm working on and picking up with clients where we left off in 2020.</p>

<p>This year I decided needed to be different to how 2020 eanded for me. I was at my end, frustrated and tired. Iâ€™m the sort of person that canâ€™t say no. I want to help everyone and never stop to consider the cost of that help. Iâ€™m not talking about the financial cost; <strong>although that is there</strong>; but Iâ€™m more referring to the time things take. Saying yes to one thing has a time cost, and that time needs to be paid up from the 24 hours of time you have. Either you have spare time that is not allocated, or you have time that needs to come out of somewhere else.</p>

<p>What I was doing, is taking time out of any time allocated for exercise and sleep. I started working nights, some weekends and slowly but surely I was heading for burnout at the least.</p>

<p>What Iâ€™m doing this year is being very intentional about what Iâ€™m doing. I have bought a little notebook and every day before I start my day I review the previous dayâ€™s notes and todo items. Then I start a new page or sections for things that I want to achieve today.</p>
