Summary: My obligatory hello post and why I'm here.

Today I start a blog. Why? Well I want to become a better communicator. So to do that I'm
going to put my thoughts on business, life, software development and everything in between
right here; in this blog.

I think it will be a great way to chronicle my journey in all aspects; maybe even write
some how-tos so I don't forget them later?

So **hello world**, see you all in the next article.
