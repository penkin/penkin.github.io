I have 16 years web and application development under my belt working on a wide range of different technologies including; C#, Python, Javascript, HTML & CSS, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ and the AWS environment.

My passion is to not just create great software, but great looking, easy to use software where the user is the central character of any solution.
