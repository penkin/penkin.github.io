<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span> got an Apple Watch to monitor my health; notifications got in the way.</p>

I’ve had an [Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/watch/) for a little while now. I got it mostly to help me monitor my health and send some of that information to my medical aid as part of their rewards program. The more I move, the more points I get, the more benefits I enjoy.

Seemed like a great idea, I love gadgets and a smartwatch that lets me auto-login to my MacBook, tell me how well I’m sleeping, how my heart is doing, how many steps I take; you get the point; seems like a great idea. Let’s not forget all those juicy points from my medical aid.

It had the reverse effect, I started getting frustrated with all the buzzing on my wrist. Did something happen on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/penkin)? Buzz! Did someone send me an email? Buzz! Some text message spam? Buzz! Incessant interruptions that I could not ignore. I’d be in meetings and the cry for attention would buzz on my arm and I’d naturally look, others in the meeting would ask if I needed to be somewhere as though I was checking the time. How much longer is this boring meeting going to go on for sort of thing!

## The Solution

So I did not just stop using my watch, instead, I decided to just cut out the noise. On the Watch app on the iPhone, you can simply [turn notifications off](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204791), either completely or select the apps you want to allow to grab your attention.

Initially, it felt extremely strange, instead of looking at my watch for why I was being buzzed, I was not looking at it for why it was not buzzing anymore. Is my watch dead? No, just less needy for attention. It’s been a week now and it’s amazing, I can sit through a meeting without distraction, continue to code without being torn away.

So as much as I wanted to use the device to help improve my health, the notifications got in the way. I found I ignored the “important” ones in all the noise of the rest.

**I highly recommend carefully choosing what you allow to take your time and attention.**
